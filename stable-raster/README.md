This example of a stable raster routine using the double IRQ technique
was ripped directly from
https://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:making_stable_raster_routines. I've
only made very minor changes to get the code to assemble with vasm.

P.S. For a great explanation of the double IRQ technique see the
following article:
